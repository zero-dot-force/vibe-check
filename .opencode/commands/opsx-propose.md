Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /opsx-apply

---

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx-propose` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with `.openspec.yaml`.

2a. **Check for uncommitted changes**

   Before creating or switching branches, run
   `git status --short`. If there are uncommitted changes
   (staged, unstaged, or untracked files that appear
   related to work):
   - **STOP** and ask the user for confirmation before
     switching branches. Show what uncommitted changes
     exist and warn that switching branches with a dirty
     working tree may cause changes to be applied to the
     wrong branch.
   - If the user confirms, proceed. If not, abort.
   - Exception: if the user explicitly requested a new
     change, this still requires confirmation -- never
     silently switch branches with uncommitted work.

2b. **Create and checkout a branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b opsx/<name>
   ```

   **Guard**: Before creating the branch, check the current branch:
   - If already on `opsx/<name>` (exact match): skip branch creation, proceed.
   - If on a different `opsx/*` branch: **STOP** with error: "Already on branch `opsx/<other>` -- finish or archive that change first."
   - If on `main` or any non-opsx branch: create and checkout `opsx/<name>`.

2c. **Retrieve context from Dewey**

   Before drafting the proposal, query Dewey for relevant context:

   - `dewey_semantic_search` with the change description to find
     related specs, past proposals, and similar changes
   - `dewey_semantic_search_filtered` with `source_type: "github"`
     to find related issues across the organization
   - `dewey_traverse` on any discovered related specs to understand
     dependencies

   Use the retrieved context to inform the proposal's scope,
   identify potential conflicts with existing work, and reference
   relevant prior decisions.

   If Dewey is unavailable, proceed without cross-repo context --
   use direct file reads of local specs and backlog items instead.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/opsx-apply` to start implementing."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next

## Guardrails

- **NEVER implement code changes** — this command
  creates artifacts ONLY (proposal, design, specs,
  tasks)
- **NEVER commit, push, or create PRs** — those are
  /uf.finale's responsibility
- **NEVER run /uf.unleash, /opsx-apply, or /uf.cobalt-crush**
  — the user decides when to implement
- After artifacts are complete, STOP and prompt the
  user to run /uf.unleash, /opsx-apply, or /uf.cobalt-crush
