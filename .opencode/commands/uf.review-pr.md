# Review Pull Request

You are a token-efficient code reviewer. The user will provide a PR number or you will auto-detect it from the current branch. Delegate deterministic checks to local tools and CI results first, then apply AI judgment only where tools cannot reach: intent alignment, security patterns, and architectural concerns.

<protect>

## Arguments

- **PR number** (optional): The pull request number to review (e.g., `42`). If omitted, the command auto-detects the open PR for the current branch.

**Argument parsing** (before any tool calls): Check the
user's message for a PR number argument. If present, set
`PR_NUMBER` to that value immediately. All subsequent steps
use `<PR_NUMBER>` — no auto-detection commands are needed
or permitted.

## Execution Steps

### 0. Prerequisites

Verify the `gh` CLI is available and authenticated before proceeding:

```bash
which gh
```

If `gh` is not found: **STOP** with error:
> "`gh` CLI is not installed. Install it from https://cli.github.com/ or via your package manager."

If `gh` is found, verify authentication:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated: **STOP** with error:
> "`gh` is installed but not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate."

#### Execution Mode Check

This command requires running local tools (build, test,
lint) as part of the review. Verify you can execute
commands by running a harmless probe:

```bash
echo "mode-check-ok"
```

If the probe cannot be executed (the agent runtime
returns a tool-access-denied error, or you are in plan
mode, read-only mode, or otherwise restricted from
running commands): **STOP** with message:

> "This review requires running local tools (build,
> test, lint) to verify the PR. I am currently in
> plan/read-only mode which prevents executing these
> checks. Switch to a mode that allows command
> execution (e.g., full mode / auto mode) and
> re-invoke `/uf.review-pr <N>`."

Do NOT proceed with a partial review that skips local
tool execution. The local tool results are the
foundation of the review — without them, AI-only
findings lack verification and the review does not
meet the command's quality standard.


### 1. Resolve PR Number

**If `PR_NUMBER` was already set from the argument**: skip
this step entirely. Do NOT run `gh pr view`,
`git branch --show-current`, or any branch/PR detection
commands.

**Only if no PR number was provided**: auto-detect from
the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'
```

If no open PR exists for the current branch: **STOP** with error:
> "No open PR found for branch '`<branch>`'. Provide a PR number: `/uf.review-pr 42`"

### 2. Fetch PR Metadata (Minimal)

Retrieve PR metadata first — avoid loading the full diff until needed:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,baseRefName,headRefName,labels,milestone,commits,reviewDecision,reviewRequests
```

Record the PR title, description, branch name, base branch, changed file list, current review decision (`REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`), and pending review requests. **Do NOT fetch the full diff yet** — later steps determine which files need AI analysis.

### 3. Fetch CI Check Results

Retrieve the CI/CD check suite status for the PR:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,description,link
```

Categorize each check as:
- **PASS**: Check succeeded
- **FAIL**: Check failed
- **PENDING**: Check still running
- **SKIPPED**: Check was skipped

If checks are still PENDING, inform the user and use
the **question tool** with options
`["Wait for checks to complete", "Proceed with
available results"]`.

**If all checks pass**: Record this and move to Step 3.5. No CI triage needed.

**If any checks fail**: Proceed to Step 3a for causality determination.

#### 3a. CI Failure Causality Determination

For each failing check, determine whether the failure is caused by the PR's changes or is a pre-existing issue on the base branch.

**Method**: Check if the same test/check also fails on the base branch:

```bash
# Get the base branch name (from Step 2 metadata, e.g., "main")
BASE_BRANCH="<baseRefName from Step 2>"

# Check the latest CI status on the base branch
# Use --jq with $ENVIRON or --arg to avoid injection from check names containing quotes
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/${BASE_BRANCH}/check-runs \
  --jq --arg name "<FAILING_CHECK_NAME>" '.check_runs[] | select(.name == $name) | {name, conclusion}'
```

**Classification**:

| Base branch status | PR check status | Classification |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Pass | Fail | **PR-caused** — the PR introduced the failure |
| Fail | Fail | **Pre-existing** — failure exists independently of the PR |
| No data | Fail | **Unknown** — treat as PR-caused (conservative) |

Record the classification for each failing check. This feeds into the AI review and fix-branch steps.

### 3.5. Pre-delegation Diff Size Check

Before delegating to the analysis subagent, check if the
diff is large enough to warrant a file-focus prompt.

Using the `additions`, `deletions`, and `files` fields
from Step 2 metadata:

1. Calculate total diff lines: `additions + deletions`
2. Count changed files: length of `files` array

**If total diff lines > 2000 OR changed files > 50**:

Use the **question tool** with options
`["Review all files", "Focus on specific files"]`.

If the user selects "Focus on specific files", follow up
with the **question tool** (open-ended, no preset
options) to ask which files or directories to focus on.

Record the user's choice as `FILE_FOCUS_SCOPE`:
- "all" if reviewing all files
- A list of file paths/patterns if focusing on specific
  files

**If total diff lines <= 2000 AND changed files <= 50**:
Set `FILE_FOCUS_SCOPE = "all"` silently.

This check moves here from Step 5 because the subagent
cannot interact with the user.

### 4. Delegate Analysis to Subagent

Delegate the token-heavy analysis (Steps 4-8) to a Task
subagent to keep the parent context small and resilient
to context compression.

Invoke the **Task tool** with:
- `subagent_type`: `"general"`
- `description`: `"PR #<PR_NUMBER> analysis"`
- `prompt`: Construct the prompt below, injecting the PR
  metadata values gathered in Steps 0-3.

**Injected context** (substitute actual values):
- `PR_NUMBER`: from Step 1
- `PR_TITLE`: from Step 2
- `PR_BODY`: from Step 2 (truncate to 2000 chars)
- `BASE_BRANCH`: from Step 2
- `HEAD_BRANCH`: from Step 2
- `CHANGED_FILES`: from Step 2 (JSON array of file paths)
- `CI_CHECK_RESULTS`: from Step 3 (JSON array of check
  results with name, state, classification)
- `FILE_FOCUS_SCOPE`: from Step 3.5

**Wait** for the subagent to return its findings. The
subagent returns a structured message containing all the
sections listed below. Parse the returned message and
proceed to Step 5 (Output Format).

---

#### BEGIN SUBAGENT PROMPT

You are analyzing PR #<PR_NUMBER> ("<PR_TITLE>") for a
code review. The parent agent has already completed
prerequisites, metadata gathering, and CI check analysis.
Your job is to run the analysis steps and return structured
findings.

**PR Metadata:**
- PR: #<PR_NUMBER> — <PR_TITLE>
- Base: <BASE_BRANCH> ← Head: <HEAD_BRANCH>
- Changed files: <CHANGED_FILES>
- File focus scope: <FILE_FOCUS_SCOPE>

**CI Check Results:**
<CI_CHECK_RESULTS>

**PR Description:**
<PR_BODY>

Execute the following analysis steps in order, then return
your findings in the structured format at the end.

##### Step A. Run Local Deterministic Tools (Pre-flight)

Load the `pre-flight` skill and run in `ci-aware` mode:

1. Invoke the `skill` tool with name `pre-flight` to
   load the shared pre-flight check instructions.

2. Execute the pre-flight skill's phases in order:
   a. CI Workflow Parsing — discover commands from
      `.github/workflows/`
   b. Local Tool Detection — check for config files
      and verify binary availability
   c. CI Coverage Matrix — build the matrix using the
      CI check results provided above. Apply ci-aware
      decision rules:
      - CI PASS → skip locally (CI already verified)
      - CI FAIL → skip locally (failure already
        captured in CI check analysis)
      - CI NONE → MUST run locally
      - No CI checks at all → MUST run ALL detected
        local tools
   d. Execution — run only tools marked "Yes" in the
      coverage matrix

3. **Record results**: Use the pre-flight result format
   (CI Coverage Matrix, Execution Results, Verdict).
   If tools pass, skip those categories in the AI
   review entirely. If tools fail, include the failure
   output as context for the AI review step.

4. **If no tools are detected**: Note this and proceed
   to AI-based review for all categories.

##### Step B. Fetch Diff (Scoped)

Now fetch the diff, being token-conscious:

```bash
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>
```

**Large diff handling** (500+ lines):

`gh pr diff` does not support file path filters. For
large diffs, save the output to a temp file and
navigate it with targeted reads:

1. Save the full diff once:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> > /tmp/pr<PR_NUMBER>.diff
   ```
   (The tool runtime auto-saves truncated output to a
   file — use that path if available instead.)

2. Find file boundaries in the saved diff:
   ```bash
   grep -n '^diff --git' /tmp/pr<PR_NUMBER>.diff
   ```
   This returns line numbers for each file's diff
   section.

3. Read specific file sections using offset/limit on
   the saved file. Skip these files entirely:
   - Lock files: `package-lock.json`, `go.sum`,
     `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock`
   - Auto-generated: `*.pb.go`, `vendor/` contents
   - Binary files
   - CRAP baselines: `.gaze/baseline.json`

4. Use FILE_FOCUS_SCOPE from the parent context to
   determine which files to analyze. If
   FILE_FOCUS_SCOPE is "all", analyze all files. If it
   contains specific file paths/patterns, focus
   analysis on those files only.

**Do NOT attempt**:
- `gh pr diff <N> -- <path>` (unsupported, will fail)
- `git show <remote>/<branch>:<path>` (PR branch may
  not be on any configured remote)
- `git fetch <remote> <branch>` (PR may come from a
  fork or push directly to PR refs)

###### Accessing full file contents from the PR branch

If you need to read a complete file from the PR branch
(not just the diff), use the GitHub API. The PR branch
may not exist on any locally configured remote:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/<path>?ref=<headRefName> \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Use `<headRefName>` from the PR metadata. If the
API call returns 404, 403, or empty content (files
>1 MB), fall back to reading from the saved diff file
and note in the review that full file content was
unavailable.

For accessing files on the PR branch, the agent MUST
use `gh api` exclusively. Any `git` subcommand
targeting the PR's head ref (`git show`, `git fetch`,
`git checkout`, `git diff` with remote refs) is
prohibited.

##### Step C. Discover Review Context

Load the `review-context` skill for spec artifact
discovery, issue linking, path classification, and
walkthrough generation:

1. Invoke the `skill` tool with name `review-context`
   to load the shared context discovery instructions.

2. Execute the skill's protocols in order:
   a. Protocol 1 (Spec Artifact Discovery) — locate
      the specification matching this PR using branch
      name from the PR metadata, PR description, and
      changed file list. If a spec is found in the
      changed file list, read from the saved diff
      (Step B) rather than the filesystem.
   b. Protocol 2 (Issue Linking) — parse the PR body
      from the PR metadata for linked issues, validate,
      fetch, sanitize, and extract acceptance criteria.
   c. Protocol 3 (Path-Based Focus Heuristics) —
      classify each changed file from the PR metadata
      for review emphasis.
   d. Protocol 4 (Walkthrough Generation) — generate
      per-file change summaries while analyzing the
      diff from Step B.

3. **Record results**: Use the skill's Review Context
   output format (Specification, Linked Issues, File
   Classification, Walkthrough). This context is used
   in the AI review step and the output.

##### Step D. Load Convention Packs (Optional)

Check if convention packs are available for enhanced review precision:

```bash
test -d .opencode/uf/packs && echo "PACKS=yes"
```

**If packs are available**:
1. Always read `.opencode/uf/packs/default.md` (language-agnostic rules)
2. Detect language and load the appropriate pack:
   - `go.mod` exists → read `.opencode/uf/packs/go.md`
   - `tsconfig.json` or `package.json` exists → read `.opencode/uf/packs/typescript.md`
3. Read corresponding `-custom.md` files if they exist (e.g., `go-custom.md`)
4. Read `.opencode/uf/packs/severity.md` if it exists — use its severity definitions instead of the inline fallback in the AI review step
5. Do NOT load `content.md` or `content-custom.md` — these contain writing standards for documentation agents, not code quality rules

Use pack rules (CS-001, AP-001, SC-001, TC-001, DR-001, etc.) alongside the constitution for more specific, actionable findings. Reference the specific rule ID in each finding.

**If packs are NOT available**: proceed without them. Use the constitution and inline severity definitions only. No error or warning needed.

##### Step E. Fetch Existing Review State

Fetch existing PR reviews and inline comments to prevent
duplicate findings and provide context for the AI review.

###### Step E.1. Fetch Reviews

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews \
  --jq '[.[] | {id: .id, user: .user.login, state: .state, body: .body, submitted_at: .submitted_at, commit_id: .commit_id}]'
```

Record each review's user, state (`APPROVED`,
`CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`, `DISMISSED`), body,
and commit ID.

###### Step E.2. Fetch Inline Comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | {path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, user: .user.login, created_at: .created_at}]'
```

Record each inline comment's file path, line number,
body, and author.

###### Step E.3. Identify Current User

```bash
gh api user --jq '.login'
```

Record the authenticated user's login for duplicate
review detection in the output step.

###### Step E.4. Token Budget

Existing review comments passed to the AI review MUST be
capped at 3000 characters total to prevent token bloat.
When the combined comment text exceeds this limit:
1. Filter to comments on files changed in this PR
2. Sort by `created_at` descending (most recent first)
3. Include comments until the 3000-character budget is
   exhausted
4. Truncate the remainder with a note: "N additional
   prior comments truncated for token budget"


###### Step E.5. Error Handling

If any `gh api` call in this step returns 403, 404, or
times out:
- Log the error
- Skip the failed sub-step
- Proceed to the AI review without the missing context

The review continues without blocking. All review state
data is additive context — its absence does not reduce
the review's capability, only its deduplication accuracy.

##### Step F. AI Review (Judgment-Based Only)

Focus AI analysis exclusively on what deterministic tools and CI cannot check. Skip any category where local tools or CI already passed.

**Existing review deduplication** (using Step E data):
Before generating findings, cross-reference existing
inline comments from Step E.2 against the current
analysis. For each finding:
- If an existing inline comment covers the same file and
  line range with a similar concern: **annotate** the
  finding as "previously raised by @user" rather than
  presenting it as new. Include the annotation in the
  output.
- If an existing review thread appears resolved (the
  author pushed fixes after the comment): **acknowledge**
  this in the finding context.
- If prior reviewer discussions provide relevant context
  for a finding: **reference** them (e.g., "Related to
  @user's comment on the same file").
- Do NOT fully suppress findings — the current review may
  have additional context or a different severity
  assessment. Annotate, don't hide.


**Path-based review focus and walkthrough**: Use the
file classifications and walkthrough summaries from
Step C (review-context skill, Protocols 3 and 4).
When reviewing each file, apply the matched focus
instruction as additive review context. Step F.2
(Security Review) applies to ALL changed files
regardless of path heuristic.

###### Step F.1. Alignment Check

Compare the PR intent (title + description + linked spec + linked issues) against the actual code changes:

- **Scope alignment**: Do the changed files match what the spec/description says should change? Flag files modified outside the stated scope.
- **Requirement coverage**: For each requirement in the spec (if found), verify the code changes address it. Flag uncovered requirements.
- **Completeness**: Are there partial implementations that could leave the system in an inconsistent state?
- **Drift detection**: Does the code do anything NOT described in the intent/spec? Flag undocumented behavioral changes.
- **Issue criteria coverage**: For each acceptance criterion from linked issues (Step C, Protocol 2), verify the code changes address it. Report uncovered criteria as MEDIUM findings with per-criterion status (COVERED / NOT COVERED / PARTIAL).
- **Issue suggestion gap detection**: After checking
  acceptance criteria, scan each linked issue body for
  explicit code suggestions — fenced code blocks
  (` ``` `), inline code spans, or clearly proposed
  one-line fixes. For each suggestion found:
  - Check whether the PR implemented the suggested
    change.
  - If implemented: no finding needed.
  - If not implemented: flag as a finding. Assess
    severity based on the risk of the gap (e.g., a
    missing guard clause on a destructive operation is
    HIGH; a missing style preference is LOW).

###### Step F.2. Security Review

Examine the diff for security vulnerabilities that linters cannot catch:

- **Input sanitization**: Are external inputs (user input, API parameters, file paths, environment variables, command arguments) validated before use in:
  - SQL queries (injection risk)
  - Shell commands (command injection)
  - File paths (path traversal)
  - HTML/template output (XSS)
  - YAML/JSON parsing (deserialization attacks)
- **Unexpected workflows**: Can the code be executed in an unintended order or context?
  - Missing authentication/authorization checks
  - Race conditions or TOCTOU vulnerabilities
  - State machine violations (skipping steps)
  - Error handling that exposes sensitive information
- **Privilege escalation**: Does the code grant permissions or elevate privileges without proper validation?
- **Secrets and credentials**: Are there hardcoded secrets, tokens, or API keys? Are secrets logged or exposed in error messages?
- **Dependency risks**: Are new dependencies well-maintained and from trusted sources?

**Adversarial input enumeration**: For each new input,
parameter, secret, or configuration value introduced
by the PR, enumerate:
- What values can a caller pass? (valid range, type,
  format)
- What happens for each edge case: empty string, wrong
  type, wrong case (e.g., `"True"` vs `"true"`),
  excessively long value, injection payload,
  null/undefined?
- Does validation exist? Is it sufficient? Is it
  applied before the value reaches any security-
  sensitive operation?
- If the input controls a security-relevant behavior
  (e.g., `skip_org_check`, `disable_verification`),
  is there an audit trail when the input is used to
  bypass a control?

Flag missing or insufficient validation as findings
with severity based on the blast radius of the
unvalidated input.

###### Step F.3. Constitution Compliance (AI-only items)

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if it exists. Extract all principles and their MUST/SHOULD rules. For each principle, check whether the PR's changes comply. **Only check items that local tools and CI did NOT already verify.**

If no constitution file exists, note this and review against general software engineering best practices. Do NOT hardcode specific principle names or numbers — each project defines its own constitution.

**Skip if already covered by local tools or CI**: naming conventions, line length, lint issues, formatting, file headers.

###### Step F.4. CI Failure Analysis

For each CI failure classified in the CI check results, provide analysis:

**PR-caused failures**: Include as HIGH or CRITICAL findings:
- Which check failed and what the error output says
- Which PR change likely caused the failure (map failing test to changed file/function)
- Suggested fix or direction

**Pre-existing failures**: Report separately with clear labeling:
- Confirm the failure also exists on the base branch
- Brief root cause analysis if determinable from the error output
- Note that this will be addressed in the fix-branch offer

###### Step F.5. CI Bot Annotation Cross-referencing

Before proceeding to consolidation, cross-reference the
inline comments from Step E.2 against the findings
generated in Steps F.1–F.4. Identify comments from CI
bots (Scorecard, Trivy, `github-advanced-security[bot]`,
Dependabot, CodeQL, etc.) that address the same files
or concern classes as your findings.

For each match:
- **Cite the bot finding** in your own finding as
  corroborating evidence (e.g., "Scorecard flagged the
  same step for unpinned dependencies").
- **Use the bot finding to strengthen** your severity
  classification — if a bot already flagged a concern
  and your analysis confirms it, the combined evidence
  supports a higher confidence level.
- Do NOT dismiss bot findings as "related but different"
  when they address the same class of problem (e.g.,
  dependency integrity, secrets exposure, container
  misconfig) in the same pipeline stage or file.

###### Step F.6. Finding Consolidation

After generating all findings from Steps F.1–F.5, perform
a consolidation pass before formatting output.

**Consolidation rule**: Group findings that (a) affect
the same component, pipeline stage, or file cluster,
(b) share a common root cause, and (c) together produce
a risk greater than any individual finding. Merge each
group into a single finding.

For each consolidated finding:
1. Use the highest individual severity as the floor,
   then apply the compound severity escalation rule from
   `severity.md` to determine if the combined severity
   is higher.
2. List each contributing factor as a sub-point in the
   finding description.
3. Cite the original category (alignment, security,
   constitution) for each contributing factor so
   traceability is preserved.
4. Present one unified recommendation that addresses
   the root cause, not separate fixes for each symptom.

**When NOT to consolidate**: Findings with independent
root causes and independent blast radii MUST remain
separate even if they appear in the same file.

###### Step F.7. Severity Calibration

After consolidation, perform a calibration pass over
every finding (including consolidated findings from
Step F.6). This step counters anchoring bias — the
tendency to compress all severities toward a "feels
right" level based on overall PR quality impressions.

For each finding:
1. Re-read the `severity.md` definition for the
   currently assigned severity level.
2. Quote the specific definition clause or example
   that matches the finding. If no clause matches,
   check the adjacent severity levels (one above, one
   below).
3. If the quoted definition maps to a **different**
   severity than the current assignment, adjust the
   severity and note the change (e.g., "Reclassified
   from MEDIUM to HIGH — matches HIGH definition:
   'unpinned CI action on mutable tag'").
4. If the definition confirms the current assignment,
   retain it with the quoted evidence.

The calibration pass MUST NOT introduce new findings
— it only adjusts severity levels on existing findings.

**Return your findings in this format:**

```

**Severity levels** (use `.opencode/uf/packs/severity.md` definitions if loaded by the subagent, otherwise use these defaults):
- **CRITICAL**: Must be fixed before merge (security vulnerabilities, data loss risks)
- **HIGH**: Should be fixed before merge (spec violations, missing tests for critical paths, PR-caused CI failures)
- **MEDIUM**: Recommended to fix (code quality, minor compliance issues)
- **LOW**: Optional improvements (style, naming suggestions)

If no issues are found in a category, state "No issues found."

### 6. Offer Fix-Branch for Pre-existing CI Failures

If Step 3a identified any **pre-existing** CI failures, offer to create a fix branch:

```
I identified <N> pre-existing CI failure(s) that are NOT caused by this PR:
- <check name>: <brief description of failure>

These failures also occur on the base branch (<BASE_BRANCH>).
```

Use the **question tool** with options
`["Yes -- create fix branch", "No -- skip"]`.

**If the user selects "Yes -- create fix branch"**:

1. **Verify clean working tree**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   If the output is not empty: **STOP** branch creation with message:
   > "Working tree has uncommitted changes. Commit or stash them before creating a fix branch."
   Switch back to the PR branch and continue to Step 7.

2. **Check for branch name collision**:
   ```bash
   git branch --list "fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>"
   ```
   If the branch already exists, inform the user:
   > "Branch `fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>` already exists. Switch to it with `git checkout fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>`, or delete it first."
   Switch back to the PR branch and continue to Step 7.

3. **Sanitize the check name** for branch-name safety:
   lowercase, replace spaces and special characters with
   hyphens, strip consecutive hyphens, remove characters
   outside `[a-z0-9._-]`, truncate to 50 characters.
   Example: `"Build (ubuntu/latest)"` → `build-ubuntu-latest`.
   Also validate that `<PR_NUMBER>` is digits only.

4. **Create a fix branch** from the base branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <BASE_BRANCH>
   git checkout -b fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<sanitized-check-name>
   ```
   Branch naming: `fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<sanitized-check-name>` (e.g., `fix/pr-42-yamllint`, `fix/pr-42-test-auth-timeout`)

5. **Analyze and propose the fix**: Use the CI failure output and the failing file(s) to determine the minimal change needed. Keep the scope as small as possible — fix only what is failing.

   >>> MANDATORY GATE: HUMAN CONFIRMATION REQUIRED <<<

   **Session-resume guard**: If this session was resumed
   from compressed context, or if you cannot verify that
   the human explicitly confirmed the fix-branch commit
   in the current uncompressed conversation history,
   you MUST re-present the commit preview below and
   obtain fresh confirmation via the **question tool**
   before committing. Do NOT rely on confirmation
   recorded in compressed context. When in doubt,
   re-confirm — false re-confirmation is harmless;
   committing without consent is a violation.

   Before committing, show the user:

   > **Fix-branch commit preview:**
   >
   > ```
   > git diff --cached --stat
   > ```
   >
   > **Proposed commit message:**
   > ```
   > fix: resolve <failing-check> CI failure
   >
   > <Brief description>
   >
   > This failure was pre-existing on <BASE_BRANCH>
   > and unrelated to PR #<PR_NUMBER>.
   >
   > Assisted-by: <model>
   > ```

   Use the **question tool** with options
   `["Commit -- apply fix",
   "Edit commit message", "Abort -- discard changes"]`.

   - **"Commit -- apply fix"**: Proceed with the commit
     using the displayed message.
   - **"Edit commit message"**: Let the user modify the
     commit message, then re-confirm.
   - **"Abort -- discard changes"**: Discard staged
     changes and skip the fix branch. Switch back to
     the PR branch.

   **CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER commit on a fix branch
   without explicit human confirmation via the
   **question tool**.

   >>> END MANDATORY GATE <<<

6. **Commit with Conventional Commits format**:
   Write the commit message to a temporary file to avoid
   shell injection from AI-generated description text,
   then commit using `-F`:
   ```bash
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit -s -F <temp-commit-message-file>
   ```
   The commit message file should contain:
   ```
   fix: resolve <failing-check> CI failure

   <Brief description of what was wrong and how the fix addresses it.>

   This failure was pre-existing on <BASE_BRANCH> and unrelated to PR #<PR_NUMBER>.

   Assisted-by: <model>
   ```

   Where `<model>` is the model family name you are
   currently running as. To resolve the model name:
   (1) read your model identifier from the system
   prompt or runtime environment; (2) remove everything
   before and including the last `/`; (3) remove
   everything after and including the first `@`;
   (4) remove any trailing date suffix matching
   `-YYYYMMDD` (a hyphen followed by exactly 8 digits);
   (5) repeatedly remove any trailing version segment
   matching `-N` (a hyphen followed by a single digit
   at the end) until no more remain; (6) validate the
   result contains only
   `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` characters. If the result is
   empty, contains invalid characters, or cannot be
   determined, use the literal string `unknown-model`
   and warn the user (e.g., "Could not determine AI
   model name — using 'unknown-model' in
   attribution").
   Remove the temp file after committing.

7. **Report to the user**:
   ```
   Fix branch created: fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>

   Changes:
   - <file>: <what changed>

   The branch is local. To review and push:
     git checkout fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>
     git log -1
     git push -u origin fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>
   ```

8. **Switch back** to the PR branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <PR_BRANCH>
   ```

**Guardrails**:
- The fix MUST be scoped to the specific failing check — no unrelated changes
- The agent MUST NOT push to the remote or file a PR automatically
- If the fix is non-trivial (requires understanding business logic, architectural decisions, or modifying more than 3 files), inform the user instead of attempting a fix:
  ```
  The CI failure in <check> appears to require a non-trivial fix involving <description>.
  I recommend investigating this separately rather than proposing an automated fix.
  ```

### 7. Offer Verdict-aligned PR Review

After presenting the review, if there are findings with
severity HIGH or above, show the following framing text:

```
I found <N> findings (X CRITICAL, Y HIGH).
Verdict: <APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT>
```

Regardless of finding severities, always offer to post
the review as a formal GitHub review on the PR. Use the
**question tool** with options
`["Yes -- post as GitHub review", "No -- terminal
summary is sufficient"]`.

**If the user selects "Yes -- post as GitHub review"**:

#### 7a. Pre-posting Checks

Before preparing comments, run three state-awareness
checks using the review state data returned by the
subagent (from its Step E):

**Duplicate review detection**: Check if a review from
the current user (from the subagent's user identification)
already exists in the review list (from the subagent's
review fetch):

- If a prior review with the **same verdict** exists:
  Inform the user that a prior review exists and the
  latest review takes precedence. Use the
  **question tool** with options
  `["Yes -- post new review", "No -- skip posting"]`.

- If a prior review with a **different verdict** exists:
  Inform the user of the prior verdict and that the new
  review will override it. Use the
  **question tool** with options
  `["Yes -- override with <new_verdict>",
  "No -- keep existing <old_verdict>"]`.

- If no prior review exists: proceed silently.

**Stale review + CODEOWNER checks** (APPROVE verdicts
only): Fetch branch protection settings in a single API
call to avoid redundant requests:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/<baseRefName>/protection \
  --jq '{dismiss_stale: .required_pull_request_reviews.dismiss_stale_reviews, require_codeowners: .required_pull_request_reviews.require_code_owner_reviews}'
```

If the API returns 404 (no branch protection) or 403
(insufficient permissions): skip both checks silently.

If `dismiss_stale` is true, display:
```
Warning: This repo dismisses stale reviews. If the author
pushes any new commits after this APPROVE, it will be
automatically invalidated and the PR will return to
REVIEW_REQUIRED. You may need to re-run /uf.review-pr after
final commits.
```

If `require_codeowners` is true, check for CODEOWNERS
file. Try each path in order, short-circuiting on the
first success:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/.github/CODEOWNERS \
  --jq '.name'
```

If that returns 404, try the next path:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/CODEOWNERS \
  --jq '.name'
```

If that also returns 404, try the third path:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/docs/CODEOWNERS \
  --jq '.name'
```

**Error handling**:
- **404 response**: treat as "file not found at this
  path" and try the next path. This is expected and
  silent.
- **Non-404 error** (network failure, 500, 429, etc.):
  stop checking further paths and display:
  ```
  Note: CODEOWNERS check was inconclusive (API error).
  Could not determine if this repo uses CODEOWNERS.
  ```
- **Success** (any path returns the file name): stop
  checking further paths. CODEOWNERS exists.

If CODEOWNERS exists and `require_code_owner_reviews` is
true, display:
```
Warning: This repo requires code owner reviews. This
APPROVE may not satisfy branch protection if this
account is not listed in CODEOWNERS.
```

**Session-resume guard**: If this session has been
   resumed from compressed context, or if you cannot
   verify that the human explicitly confirmed the review
   in the current uncompressed conversation history, you
   MUST re-present the review content (verdict + all
   comments) and obtain fresh confirmation via the
   **question tool** before posting. Do NOT rely
   on confirmation recorded in compressed context. When
   in doubt, re-confirm — false re-confirmation is
   harmless; posting without consent is a violation.


1. **Prepare comments**: For each finding that maps to a
   specific file and line range in the diff, prepare an
   in-line comment with:
   - The finding description
   - The severity level
   - A concrete suggestion for fixing the issue

   **Suggestion block format**: When a finding has a
   concrete single-file code fix (literal replacement),
   format it using GitHub's suggestion block syntax:

   ````
   **[HIGH] Description of the issue**

   ```suggestion
   corrected code here
   ```
   ````

   Use suggestion blocks ONLY for literal code
   replacements that can be applied as-is. MUST NOT use
   suggestion blocks for:
   - Architectural or design recommendations
   - Multi-file changes
   - Removal of security controls (input validation,
     auth checks, error handling, lint suppressions)

   For these cases, use plain text with an explanation.

   Cap at 15 comments maximum. If more than 15 findings
   qualify, prioritize CRITICAL over HIGH. Include
   remaining findings in the review body summary.

>>> MANDATORY GATE: HUMAN CONFIRMATION REQUIRED <<<

2. **Show all comments for human review**: Present each
   prepared comment with its full before/after context:
   ```
   File: <path>
   Line: <line_number>
   Type: suggestion / plain-text
   Body: <comment text with suggestion block if applicable>
   ```

3. **Verdict-aligned confirmation**: Map the verdict from
   Step 5 to the GitHub API event type:
   - APPROVE → `"event": "APPROVE"`
   - REQUEST CHANGES → `"event": "REQUEST_CHANGES"`
   - COMMENT → `"event": "COMMENT"`

   Display the verdict context, then use the
   **question tool** for confirmation:

   For APPROVE verdicts: inform the user that this may
   unblock merge in repos with branch protection and
   that the review will be labeled as AI-generated.
   Use the **question tool** with options
   `["Approve -- post review", "No -- skip posting",
   "Edit comments first", "Change verdict"]`.

   For REQUEST CHANGES or COMMENT verdicts: inform the
   user that this will block merge in repos with branch
   protection. Use the **question tool** with
   options `["Yes -- post review", "No -- skip posting",
   "Edit comments first", "Change verdict"]`.

   The "Change verdict" option lets the user override the
   computed verdict (e.g., downgrade REQUEST CHANGES to
   COMMENT).

4. **Post as a single review event**: Construct a JSON
   payload containing the event type, review body, and
   inline comments array. Write the payload to a
   temporary file and submit via:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews \
     --method POST \
     --input <json-file>
   ```

   The review body MUST include the line:
   `_This review was generated by /uf.review-pr
   (AI-assisted)._`

   Always write the JSON payload to a temporary file
   rather than interpolating AI-generated text into shell
   arguments, to prevent shell injection. Remove the
   temporary file after posting.

   **Graceful degradation**: If `gh api` returns HTTP 403
   or 422 (insufficient permissions, non-collaborator, or
   self-review prohibition), fall back to posting as
   `"event": "COMMENT"` with a note:
   > "Note: Could not post as <original verdict> due to
   > insufficient permissions. Posted as COMMENT instead.
   > Original verdict: <APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES>."

   If the fallback also fails, inform the user that their
   token lacks write permissions for PR reviews and
   suggest re-authenticating with `gh auth login`.

   - **"No -- skip posting"**: Skip posting, the terminal summary is sufficient
   - **"Edit comments first"**: Let the user modify comments before posting, then re-confirm with the **question tool**

5. **CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER post reviews without explicit
   human confirmation via the **question tool**.
   Always show the exact content (verdict type + all
   comments) that will be posted and wait for the user
   to select a confirming option. For APPROVE verdicts,
   the user MUST select the "Approve -- post review"
   option — a clearly-labeled action that conveys the
   merge-unblocking consequence.
