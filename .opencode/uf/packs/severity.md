# Severity Convention Pack

This pack defines the shared severity levels used by all
five Divisor Council personas. All personas MUST reference
these definitions rather than defining severity inline.

## Severity Levels

### CRITICAL

**Definition**: The change introduces a defect that will
cause data loss, security breach, build failure, or
constitutional violation. The change MUST NOT be merged.

**Boundary**: Immediate, concrete harm. Not theoretical
risk — actual breakage or exposure.

| Persona | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| Adversary | Hardcoded production secret, SQL injection vector, panic in library code |
| Tester | Missing coverage strategy in spec/plan (Constitution IV violation), test that masks a real failure |
| Guard | Constitution principle violated without justification, implementation contradicts spec acceptance criteria |
| SRE | Release pipeline broken (won't produce artifacts), destructive operation without guard, critical CVE in dependency |
| Architect | Fundamental misalignment with project architecture (score 1-2), circular dependency introduced |

### HIGH

**Definition**: The change introduces significant risk or
technical debt that will cause problems if not addressed
before merge. Blocks the review.

**Boundary**: Likely to cause problems in the near term.
Requires action but not an emergency.

| Persona | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| Adversary | Credentials logged at INFO level, unpinned CI action on mutable tag, unchecked type assertion |
| Tester | Vague acceptance criteria ("works correctly"), shallow assertions (err == nil only), missing regression test for known bug |
| Guard | Scope creep beyond spec, acceptance criterion with no corresponding task, undocumented constitution trade-off |
| SRE | Missing upgrade path for format change, hardcoded environment values, no error recovery for I/O failure |
| Architect | Notable architectural deviation (score 5-6), competing pattern for same abstraction, significant DRY violation |

### MEDIUM

**Definition**: The change has a quality issue that should
be addressed but does not block the merge. In Spec Review
Mode, auto-fixable.

**Boundary**: Improvement opportunity. The code/spec works
but could be better.

| Persona | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| Adversary | Overly broad file permissions (0o755 → 0o644), missing context in error wrap, redundant file read |
| Tester | Missing fixture specification, test isolation concern (shared state but no observed failure), convention deviation |
| Guard | Minor scope addition beyond spec (gold plating), stale cross-reference, metadata inconsistency |
| SRE | Missing operational documentation section, incomplete platform support, unquantified performance requirement |
| Architect | Minor convention deviation, missing GoDoc on exported function, test naming doesn't follow pattern |

### LOW

**Definition**: Minor style or documentation improvement.
Non-blocking. In Spec Review Mode, auto-fixable.

**Boundary**: Cosmetic or informational. No functional
impact.

| Persona | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| Adversary | Comment suggesting security review for future feature, minor naming inconsistency in error variable |
| Tester | Minor test naming convention issue, optional observability enhancement in test output |
| Guard | Minor documentation wording improvement, optional cross-reference addition |
| SRE | Style improvement in error messages, optional health check enhancement, minor doc gap |
| Architect | Formatting preference, optional structural improvement, minor comment enhancement |

## Compound Severity Escalation

When multiple findings share a root cause, personas MUST
assess the **combined** severity rather than classifying
each finding in isolation. Findings that individually
appear LOW or MEDIUM can compound into a HIGH or
CRITICAL finding when they create a single coherent
attack surface or failure mode.

**Rule**: If two or more findings (a) affect the same
component or pipeline stage, (b) share a common root
cause, and (c) together produce a risk greater than any
individual finding, consolidate them into a single
finding at the escalated severity. The consolidated
finding MUST cite each contributing factor.

| Pattern | Individual | Compound |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Unverified binary + privileged CI container | MEDIUM + MEDIUM | HIGH (supply chain attack in privileged context) |
| Broad permissions + missing input validation + external-facing endpoint | MEDIUM + MEDIUM + MEDIUM | HIGH (unauthenticated access with elevated privileges) |
| Missing error handling + missing retry + critical data path | MEDIUM + LOW + context | HIGH (silent data loss on transient failure) |

**When NOT to escalate**: Findings that happen to appear
in the same PR but have independent root causes and
independent blast radii MUST NOT be artificially
consolidated. Consolidation applies only when the
findings are causally linked.

## Auto-Fix Policy (Spec Review Mode)

| Severity | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| LOW | Auto-fix | Cosmetic; safe to fix without human judgment |
| MEDIUM | Auto-fix | Quality improvement; deterministic fix |
| HIGH | Report only | Requires human judgment on intent/scope |
| CRITICAL | Report only | Requires human judgment; may indicate design issue |

This policy is implemented in `/uf.review-council` Spec
Review Mode. The severity definitions above ensure all 5
personas classify the same type of issue at the same
level, making the auto-fix boundary predictable.
